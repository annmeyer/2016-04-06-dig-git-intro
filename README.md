This is the repo for DIB git training intro

You can edit in github!

I'm editing on my local computer.

# header 1

- bullet 1
- bullet 2
    - nested 1
    - nested 2

1. item 1
1. item 2
3. item 3

```python
print('hello')
```

This is a change in github that's not at the same place as my local computer.
